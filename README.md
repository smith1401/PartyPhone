# Arduino Rotary phone for "offline" parties
An electronics/software project providing all the information about how to convert an old rotary phone into a modern cell phone.
## Foreword
Who doesn't know it, you are at a party and everyone is checking their phones or swiping through their Instagram. I find it very annoying when people stop communicating and instead dive into the digital world.

Somehow I have always felt jealous of people growing up before the digital age. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy that tinkering and developing new things is very easy to do nowadays, but sometimes we seem to forget that our smartphone is **not** our best friend ðŸ˜…

OK, enough of me rambling on. Let's briefly talk about how it all started and then get into the details.

## Project idea
When my girlfriend's grandma tidied up her attic, she found an old rotary phone they used back in the 80s (it seems like all phones here in Austria were olive green back in the days ðŸ¤¨). As my girlfriend knows me very well, she saved it from the trash and gave it to me saying, "I know you love this old electronics stuff ..." (she really knows me well ðŸ˜„).
In this moment the idea was born to convert the old rotary phone and bring it's internals to the 21st century. What I always wanted to preserve were the looks and feels of an old rotary phone though. In the beginning this was just an idea but I really did not have a use-case for it.

The whole thing started to take shape when I was at a party where exactly the things described before happened and I thought to myself, 'How cool would it be if there were no smartphones at all and maybe just an old regular phone (a rotary phone) for emergencies or ordering a pizza'. Then immediately the old rotary phone of my girlfriend's grandparents popped into my mind ðŸ™‚

## Research
As I work in research, the first thing I always do is, well, research ðŸ˜ƒ Someone must have had the same idea before or must have thought of at least something similiar. It is always good to use things someone has had already wrapped their head around. And sure enough, I found something. Sparkfun had a product called [Bluetooth Portable Rotary Phone](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/8929) in their portfolio a few years ago. Unfortunately, it got retired. Luckily, they still provide all the details about the circuit they used, as well as information about the rotary dial, the ringer circuit, you name it :) A huge thank you to Sparkfun for providing all this information for free.


## Hardware
With research out of the way, I started to think about the components I would need for such a project. As I wanted it to be quick and simple, I mostly used modules instead of developing my own PCB. So really any hobbyist can build it. The hardware components I used are as follows

* Rotary phone
* SIM800(LC) (2G Cellular phone module)
* LN293N (H-bridge)
* Arduino (Pro mini, nano, etc.)
* Voltage boost module (XL6009, SX1308, etc.)
* Li-Po (Li-on) battery
* Li-Po charger module (TP4056)
* USB-Serial Converter (optional)

Those are the essential components. Of course you will need some more passive components like resistors and capacitors, but I assume anyone trying to build this project will have some laying around.

## Schematic
In the schematic you can see that I mostly used PCB modules to keep things simple. The only custom built section is the part where the microcontroller interfaces with the H-bridge. It has all been layed out on a perfboard with connectors for the individual modules.

## Firmware
The firmware has been developed in Arduino C++, again to keep things simple for everyone. The code is by no means optimized or anything and I know C runs a lot quicker on those tiny 8-bit microcontrollers. I personally find the Arduino enviroment very handy for quick prototyping and so on, as a lot of useful libraries exist.

The main firmware structure is oriented towards a finite-state-machine approach. I found a very nice [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ2rHqBXO1s&t=368s) by a YouTube channel called [Playful Technology](https://www.youtube.com/c/PlayfulTechnology/featured). He uses an old rotary phone as a prop in an Escape Room game. Definitely worth a watch ðŸ™‚!

For an overview I created a state diagram of the main program flow (I tried to use [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) for the first time, this is why it looks a bit messy ðŸ˜„). 

![state-diagram](docs/state_diagram.png)

The main Arduino ```loop()``` consists of 4 simple update routines which check the switches, update timers, receive data from the SIM800 module and update the state machine.

```cpp
void loop()
{
  updateSwitches();
  updateTickers();
  updateSIM800();
  updateStateMachine();
}
```

Altough the code is by no means optimized, the main loop runs with an update rate of > 10 kHz, which I think is more than enough. Thanks again to Playful Technology for leading my to a finite-state-machine approach. I also found a nice tutorial regarding FDMs on [arduinoplusplus](https://arduinoplusplus.wordpress.com/2019/07/06/finite-state-machine-programming-basics-part-1/) if you are interested.
