# PartyPhone

## Foreword
Who doesn't know it, you are at a party and everyone is checking their phones or swiping through their instagram. I find it very annoying when people stop communicating at instead dive into the digital world. 

Somehow I have always felt jealous of people growing up before the digital age. Don't get me wrong I really enjoy that tinkering and developing new things is very easy to do nowadays, but sometimes we seem to forget that our smartphone is not our best fried ðŸ˜…

OK, enough of me rambling on. You are here for an electronics project!

## Project idea
When my girlfriend's grandma tidied up her attic, she found an old rotary phone they used back in the 80s. As my girlfriend knows me very well she saved it from the trash and gave it to me saying "I know you love this old electronics stuff ..." (she really knows me well ðŸ˜„).
In this moment the idea was born to convert the old rotary phone's internals to a cell phone (bring internal to the 21st century). One thing I always wanted to preserve were the looks and feels of an old rotary phone though. In the beginning this was just an idea but I really did not have an use-case for it.

The whole thing started to take shape when I was at a party where exatly those things described in the foreword happened and I thought to myself, 'How cool would it be if there were no smartphones at all and maybe just an old regular phone (a rotary phone) for emergencies and ordering a pizza for example'. Then immediately the old rotary phone of my girlfriend's grandparents popped into my mind ðŸ™‚

Then the tinkering began!

## Research
As I work in research, the first thing I always do is, well researching ðŸ˜ƒ Someone must have had the same idea before or at least something similiar. It is always good to use things someone has already wrapped their head around. And sure enough, there was something almost as I needed.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
